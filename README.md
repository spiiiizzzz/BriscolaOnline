# Briscola Online

A webapp implementation of the popular Italian card game

## Why?

Bored, and I didn't really find any other implementation that wasn't a mobile app with microtransactions

## Are you gonna implement 2v2?

No. I implemented the whole thing with 1v1 in mind and adding 2v2 would require too much refactoring. It's a hobby project and i don't plan on playing it in 2v2 so I don't really care

## Why are the cards cropped wrong?

Cause I'm just a dude with GIMP, not a professional graphics designer

## Can I contribute?

Sure! Just make a PR
